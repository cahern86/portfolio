    <h1>DNA Test Results</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>23andMe</h2>
    <p>Recently, I was gifted a DNA test kit for 23andMe. And while I was scared to send my DNA sample to a private company who could sell my information to countless insurance companies, etc., I didn't want to be rude. So, I spit into a vial and sent my saliva on its merry way.</p>
      <aside>
        <p>23andMe has sold in excess of 10 million DNA testing kits. More than 80% of their customers have agreed to their data being used by the company for research and by scientists trying to understand the causes of diseases and how best to treat them. For more information on the dangers of sharing your DNA, view <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/16/5-biggest-risks-of-sharing-dna-with-consumer-genetic-testing-companies.html">5 Biggest Risks of Sharing your DNA with consumer genetic-testing companies.</a></p>
      </aside>
    <p>You always want (or perhaps expect) your DNA to confirm what you already know. The story you've been told by your parents and grandparents of your proud ancestral heritage. So, I expected my results to say German and Mexican, or something similar. However, my results were somewhat more fascinating. Somewhat.</p>
    <p>Assuming they didn't mix up my DNA sample with someone else's, my results should be reliable, right?
    <p>Well, apparently I'm:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>32% French and German</li>
        <li>20% Spanish and Portuguese (ole!)</li>
        <li>20% Native American (wait...what?)</li>
        <li>17% British and Irish</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Throw in a small percentage of Sub-Saharan African and a few "broadly European" phrases, and BAM! You get me.</p>

    <h3>Native American</h3>
    <p>So, naturally this got me researching. Native American, you say? That's interesting.</p>
    <p>Turns out my grandma on my father's side is from Guadalajara, Mexico (which I think I knew). And she's indigenous indian (which I forgot). Now, my dad gets mixed up talking about about it, but he says she was Maya, not Mayan, or something along those lines. But not the famous one. Okay dad, thanks.</p>

    <h3>Spanish and Portuguese</h3>
    <p>It also turns out that my dad's dad was a spaniard. He was blonde with blue/green eyes. They called him "los ojos de gato" or "cat eyes" because his eyes would change colors like a mood ring. Now that's cool.</p>

    <h3>Neanderthal</h3>
    <p>According to 23andMe, I have more Neanderthal DNA than 50% of other customers. Which is like, huh? I mean, it explains my forehead. But really, what?</p>
    <p>So, I have less than 2% Neanderthal DNA. Apparently, this can influence my traits, such as if I get hangry, if I have a fear of heights, or if I prefer salty to sweet. Of course, all of their assumptions about my traits/preferences were incorrect, but hey, kind of cool, right?</p>
    <aside>
      <p>Neanderthals lived throughout western Eurasia - from Wales to southern Siberia near the Altai mountains. Researchers think climate change, a violent lifestyle, or decreasing fertility could have played a role in their extinction around 40,000 years ago. It's also possible Neanderthals were just absorbed into the human population.</p>
